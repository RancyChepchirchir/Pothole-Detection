# Pothole Detection

The ups and downs of the weather can leave us feeling bruised and confused but our roads endure the brunt of it day in, day out. Local authorities fight a constant battle against the lumps, bumps and holes that tear up the tarmac after heavy rain, ice and snow and (the increasingly regular) particularly hot days. We all know they make driving difficult but what damage could they do to your car and what can you do about them?

To counter this problem I have created this repository to detect potholes from images and can classify images if it is normal or having potholes.

Using Deep Learning we can easily classify images into Normal and Potholes
